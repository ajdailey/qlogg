/**
 * The JVM shutdown hook's task, for an exit that skips the ordered quit (SIGTERM, logoff, a parent
 * ending the process). Unless the quit has finished, it asks for the quit, which runs on the UI
 * thread and its lifecycle worker (cancel, save the settings and the session, close the documents
 * and the workers), and waits up to its bound. Past the bound it logs the threads still running and
 * returns, and the JVM halts. Either way it then runs {@code release} (removing the handoff
 * endpoint). It touches no widget: the request goes through the UI dispatcher, which drops it once
 * the Display is disposed. A second run, or a run after the quit finished, only releases.
