# qlogg-dist

Builds the universal jar and zip, the six per-target bundles and the
launchers. Packaging is `src/build/dist.xml`, run by maven-antrun-plugin at
`package` after the dependency plugin stages the jars and launch4j builds
`qlogg.exe`. Archives go to the top-level `dist/`, which no build step deletes.

`qlogg.exe` and the archives need an x86-64 Linux build host; the
`archive-host` profile (`os.name` Linux, `os.arch` amd64) turns them on. On
any other host the module builds `target/qlogg.jar` only, and `SmokeTest`
runs against it.

---

## Universal jar

`target/qlogg.jar` holds the bootstrap classes at the root, the application
jars under `META-INF/qlogg/lib/`, the six SWT fragments unmodified under
`META-INF/qlogg/swt/<target>.jar`, a SHA-256 for every native, and
`index.properties` (layout in `qlogg-bootstrap/README.md`). The maven-shade
plugin cannot merge the fragments, which share class names.

`qlogg-<version>.zip` holds `qlogg/lib/qlogg.jar`, `qlogg/bin/qlogg`,
`qlogg/qlogg.exe`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and `THIRD-PARTY.txt` (every bundled
third-party component and its license text).

## Bundles

Each bundle carries the same universal jar plus a runtime for its target, so
every target runs the jar that was tested.

| Target | Archive | Layout |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `.tar.gz` | `qlogg/bin/qlogg`, `qlogg/lib/qlogg.jar`, `qlogg/lib/swt/`, `qlogg/runtime/` |
| Windows | `.zip` | `qlogg/qlogg.exe`, `qlogg/lib/qlogg.jar`, `qlogg/lib/swt/`, `qlogg/runtime/` |
| macOS | `.zip` | `QLogg.app/Contents/{Info.plist, MacOS/QLogg, app/QLogg.cfg, app/lib/qlogg.jar, runtime/, Resources/QLogg.icns, Resources/swt/}` |

`lib/swt/` holds the target's natives, `about.html` and `about_files/`,
unzipped from the same fragment the jar carries, so the bootstrap verifies
them against the jar's digests and never writes there. The macOS bundle has no
`lib/swt/`: rcodesign re-signs every Mach-O file in the bundle, which changes
the jnilib bytes, so the bootstrap extracts the natives from the jar into the
user cache on first start, with Eclipse's signatures intact. The SWT notices
are in `Resources/swt/`.

A `qlogg.conf` marker selects portable mode; where it goes is in [Settings
directory](../qlogg-app/docs/settings.md#settings-directory).

The runtime is linked by the build JDK's `jlink` from the target JDK's jmods
(Temurin 21.0.12+8, downloaded and verified by SHA-256) with
`java.base,java.logging,java.naming,jdk.charsets,jdk.unsupported,jdk.zipfs`,
`--strip-java-debug-attributes`, `--no-header-files` and `--no-man-pages`.
`jdk.charsets` carries the Encoding menu's CJK charsets, which `java.base`
lacks on Windows and macOS. `jdeps` reports `java.desktop` too, used only by
`SWT_AWT`, so it is left out. `--strip-debug` is not used: it runs the host
`objcopy` on target binaries and fails across targets.

jlink on Linux writes the `legal/<module>/` notices as symlinks into
`legal/java.base/`. The build replaces them with copies before signing,
because Ant's `zip` stores a link as a regular file and the macOS seal must
match what unzips.

## Reproducible output

Every archive entry, and every entry of `qlogg.jar`, is dated
`project.build.outputTimestamp` (parent POM; set it to the release date when
the version changes):

- `jar` and `zip` take `modificationtime` from `archive.time`, the instant's
  UTC wall time. Ant writes DOS entry times in the host time zone, so every
  host then writes the same fields.
- The `.tar.gz` bundles are written by GNU `tar` with entries sorted by name,
  one mtime, owner and group 0, and modes set by `chmod` beforehand, then
  compressed by Ant's `gzip`. Ant's `tar` has no `modificationtime`.
- `qlogg.jar` is byte-identical across build hosts under one JDK: `dist.xml`
  rewrites the native digests to LF and sorts the `index.properties` lists by
  name, case-sensitive.
- launch4j's `ld` stamps `qlogg.exe` with the link time. `PeTimestamp.java`
  rewrites the COFF time stamp and the PE checksum to the values `ld` writes
  with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` set, which cannot reach `ld` inside the Maven JVM.

The jlink runtimes and the ad-hoc rcodesign signature hold no build time.
jlink runs under `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8`: under a non-UTF-8 locale it writes a
different `lib/modules`. `.github/scripts/check-reproducible.sh` builds twice,
the second time under another time zone, umask and locale, and compares the SHA-256 of every archive,
`qlogg.exe` and module jar.

## Release artifacts

`-Psbom` writes `dist/qlogg-<version>-sbom.cdx.json`, a CycloneDX aggregate
SBOM of the compile and runtime dependencies (cyclonedx-maven-plugin
`makeAggregateBom`, run once in the parent, `qlogg-bench` excluded). The
`sbom` profile here adds the six SWT fragments as dependencies so the SBOM
lists them; `stage-lib` excludes `org.eclipse.platform`, so the archives are
unchanged.

A pushed `v*` tag ends in a draft GitHub Release holding the seven archives,
`SHA256SUMS` and the SBOM; the maintainer reviews and publishes it. Steps and
recovery are in the root `README.md` under "Continuous integration".

## Launchers

| Launcher | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `bin/qlogg` (POSIX sh) | Java from `<home>/runtime`, else `$JAVA_HOME`, else `PATH`; `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=50 -XX:GCTimeRatio=1`, plus `-XstartOnFirstThread` on Darwin. Follows `$0` symlinks with plain `readlink`. Runs only `uname` and `readlink` besides Java |
| `qlogg.exe` (launch4j 3.50, `gui`) | Runs `lib\qlogg.jar` with a Java 21+ found in `runtime`, `%JAVA_HOME%`, then `%PATH%`; 64-bit only; `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=50 -XX:GCTimeRatio=1`. The launch4j header is a 32-bit x86 program that starts `javaw.exe` as a child process; on Windows arm64 it runs under x86 emulation and starting the arm64 runtime is unverified |
| `QLogg.app/Contents/MacOS/QLogg` | The `jpackageapplauncher` binary from the target JDK's `jdk.jpackage` module. It reads `Contents/app/QLogg.cfg` and starts `Contents/runtime` with `-XstartOnFirstThread`, `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=50` and `-XX:GCTimeRatio=1`; the layout copies jpackage's and is unverified on macOS |

`rcodesign` 0.29.0 ad-hoc signs each `QLogg.app` on Linux with
`src/macos/qlogg.entitlements` (`allow-jit`,
`allow-unsigned-executable-memory`, `disable-library-validation`), which the
JVM needs under the hardened runtime. rcodesign cannot sign a shell script as
the main executable, so the macOS launcher is the jpackage binary.
CI unzips each macOS bundle and runs `codesign --verify --deep --strict` on it.
The bundles are not notarized. On every target, the CI `bundle` job also runs
the universal zip's launcher (`bin/qlogg`, or `qlogg.exe` on Windows) with
setup-java's JDK as `JAVA_HOME`.

## Icons

`src/icons/qlogg.svg` is the OS-facing icon (window, taskbar, Dock, `.exe`,
`.icns`); `qlogg-light.svg` is for in-app use with the light palette.
`tools/icons.sh` renders `qlogg.ico`, `QLogg.icns` and the PNGs in
`qlogg-ui-swt` from them; the build uses the committed outputs.

## Testing

`SmokeTest` (tag `swt`) runs at `integration-test` against the built jar and,
on linux-x86_64, the extracted bundle:

| Case | Checks |
|---|---|
| `java -jar qlogg.jar -v` | Prints the manifest version as its first line |
| Jar content | LF native digests and `natives.<target>` lists sorted by name, so a Windows build writes the same jar |
| `java -jar qlogg.jar` | Opens a 900 x 600 window at 50,40 and writes no `logs` folder |
| Linux bundle with `-l`, `PATH` holding only `uname` and `readlink` | Reports its own `runtime/` as `java.home`, opens the same window, and after SIGTERM leaves one `qlogg-<pid>.log` holding the shutdown hook's line and no other file in `logs` |
| Linux bundle runtime | Has `jdk.charsets` and supports every charset the Encoding menu lists (`CharsetProbe`) |
